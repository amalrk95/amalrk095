Introduction
Data is huge and it is everywhere but along with that comes the need to understand data and base our decisions after drawing inferences from data.

One of the major steps that we have in the field in data science is first exploring the data thereby presenting it in the form of informative plots and it is referred to as Data Visualization.

We are very visual creatures as a large portion of brain dedicates itself to visual processing. Images are able to grab our attention easily, we are immediately drawn to them.

John Tukey was an American mathematician best known for the development of the FFT algorithm and boxplot.Here are some of his notable quotes on the importance of visualization through graphs.
